It’s been a long time since I first thought of building something that could help me with both my daily clothing choices and my shopping habits. That’s why I built SWA, the Smart Wardrobe Assistant. It’s still in its early stages, but it’s starting to take shape. My approach to tackling compulsive buying and encouraging more conscious consumption, using RFID to track and manage wardrobes,  is not very polished yet, but at this stage I’m focused on building a working prototype, which I developed as part of my Web Methodologies exam project at Uniupo. In the long run, I see it as a way to also push back against fast fashion and its wasteful cycle of overconsumption.
